  Tech stacks : React+TS+useReducer hook
    Here’s what i build while learing ts on day two:
        => Defined a State interface (clear shape of state).
        => Used union in Action type → each action is strictly typed.
        => Implemented a reducer instead of multiple useState → scalable for more operations.
        => Proper error handling (division by zero).
        => Clean UI with inline CSS → minimal distractions, focus on TS + logic.
