What are Custom Hooks?

    A custom hook is just a JavaScript function whose name starts with "use" and that can call other hooks inside it.
    It allows you to extract and reuse logic across multiple components.
    Custom hooks help keep components clean and DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself).
    👉 Think of them as “logic components without UI”.

Why use Custom Hooks?

    Reuse complex logic across multiple components.
    Improve code readability & maintainability.
    Encapsulate side effects, state, subscriptions, etc.
    Make UI components smaller and focused only on rendering.
